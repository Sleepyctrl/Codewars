 Practice using LINQ and REGEX
 
Task1:
Given a string str, reverse it and omit all non-alphabetic characters.

Example
For str = "krishan", the output should be "nahsirk".

For str = "ultr53o?n", the output should be "nortlu".

Input/Output
[input] string str
A string consists of lowercase latin letters, digits and symbols.

[output] a string

Task2:
An infinite number of shelves are arranged one above the other in a staggered fashion.
The cat can jump either one or three shelves at a time: from shelf i to shelf i+1 or i+3 (the cat cannot climb on the shelf directly above its head)
Input
Start and finish shelf numbers (always positive integers, finish no smaller than start)

Task
Find the minimum number of jumps to go from start to finish

Example
Start 1, finish 5, then answer is 2 (1 => 4 => 5 or 1 => 2 => 5)

Task3:
Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

Example:

Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

Task4:
Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Examples
[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

Task5:
Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

For example (Input --> Output):

39 --> 3 (because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4 = 4 and 4 has only one digit)
999 --> 4 (because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126, 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2)
4 --> 0 (because 4 is already a one-digit number)

Task6:
A string is considered to be in title case if each word in the string is either (a) capitalised (that is, only the first letter of the word is in upper case) or (b) considered to be an exception and put entirely into lower case unless it is the first word, which is always capitalised.

Write a function that will convert a string into title case, given an optional list of exceptions (minor words). The list of minor words will be given as a string with each word separated by a space. Your function should ignore the case of the minor words string -- it should behave in the same way even if the case of the minor word string is changed.

Arguments (Haskell)
First argument: space-delimited list of minor words that must always be lowercase except for the first word in the string.
Second argument: the original string to be converted.
Arguments (Other languages)
First argument (required): the original string to be converted.
Second argument (optional): space-delimited list of minor words that must always be lowercase except for the first word in the string. The JavaScript/CoffeeScript tests will pass undefined when this argument is unused.
Example
Kata.TitleCase("a clash of KINGS", "a an the of")   => "A Clash of Kings"
Kata.TitleCase("THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS", "The In") => "The Wind in the Willows"
Kata.TitleCase("the quick brown fox")               => "The Quick Brown Fox"
